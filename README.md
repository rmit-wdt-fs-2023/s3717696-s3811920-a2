## Admin WEB-API
The Admin WEB-API project consists of a RESTful API that is responsible for handling all the database operations and endpoints for the bank's admin portal. The API is built using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core and has the following features:

- CRUD operations.
- Endpoints for blocking and unblocking customer accounts.
- Endpoints for blocking and unblocking bills.

## Admin WEB

The Admin WEB project is a web application that connects to the Admin WEB-API endpoints and provides an easy-to-use interface for the bank's admin staff to manage customer accounts and transactions. The web application is built using ASP.NET Core and Razor Pages.

## Customer WEB
The Customer WEB project is a web application that allows customers to log in and manage their banking details. The web application is built using ASP.NET Core and Razor Pages. It has the following features:

- A login page for customers to access their account.
- A page for customers to deposit, transfer or withdraw from their accounts.
- A page for customers to update their personal details
- A page for printing a transaction history for the customer's accounts.
