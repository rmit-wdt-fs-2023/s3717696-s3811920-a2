- CRUD operations.
- Endpoints for blocking and unblocking customer accounts.
- Endpoints for blocking and unblocking bills.

## Admin WEB

The Admin WEB project is a web application that connects to the Admin WEB-API endpoints and provides an easy-to-use interface for the bank's admin staff to manage customer accounts and transactions. The web application is built using ASP.NET Core and Razor Pages.

- Allows operation to edit a customer's general details and address.
- Can lock/unlock a login for a user.
- Can lock/unlock a bill.
